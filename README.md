# ruby-playground

ðŸ“š Learning and exploring the Ruby programming language.


## Overview

This repository is me learning Ruby and specifically the surrounding toolchain and basic language features.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to explore Ruby via various scripts and programs.

1. Pre-requisite: Ruby
   * I used Ruby 3.3.2 installed with `rbenv`
2. Run a basic script
   * ```shell
     ruby hello-world.rb 
     ```
   * The commandline and output will look something like the following.
   * ```text
     $ ruby hello-world.rb 
     
     Hello World!
     ```



## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE Let's get something running
* [ ] How does package management work? Ruby Gems of course, but what is the package manager?
* [ ] How does modularization work in Ruby? Packages?
* [ ] How does debugging work in Ruby? Does it have something like an agent, like the JVM does?
* [ ] What is `frozen_string_literal`?
